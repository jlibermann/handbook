Initial Conditions
------------------

-  The instrument box is unloaded at LCO

-  Cleanroom "unpacking room" is clear

Preparations
------------

-  ensure that the cart/lifting-fixture is ready to be assembled, with all hardware in hand

-  ensure that the 2x 2-wire lifting harnesses are present

-  At least 5 personnel are needed.  All should have appropriate PPE (hard hats and safety shoes)

-  find a crane scale good for at least 2500 lbs.


Open The Box
------------

-  Place the large box with the optical bench in the unpacking area, setting it down on 4 furniture dollies as shown.

Note: the removable side wall should be facing towards the outer garage door

-  Install the handles on the removable side panel.

-  Remove all but two bolts from the side panel

-  With 4 workers standing by to handle the panel, remove the final bolts.  The panel fits very snugly so it will not fall out on its on.

-  Remove the side panel.  This takes 4 workers.

-  Set the side panel out of the way outside

-  Conduct initial inspection of the instrument, including drop-n-tells.  Remove the data recorders (this may have been done via the inspection ports already)

-  Totate the box on dollies 180 degrees so the opening faces into the cleanroom

-  Remove all bolts attaching the box top to the aluminum pallet.  Store in a safe place.

-  Install the lifting eyes on the box lid, and attach the load spreader the box lid as shown. The load spread should be driven to the correct mark.

-  Stage 4x furniture dollies to set the lid on, between the pallet and the outer garage door.

-  Open the inner garage door

-  position a worker at each corner to guid the lid

-  Lift the lid with the crane, with the 4 corner guides ensuring that it goes straight up.

-  Once the lid is safely clear of the palette lip, move the palette on its dollies into the cleanroom

-  Close the inner door behind it.

CAUTION: Do not have both garage doors open at the same time.

-  Set the lid on the remaining 4 dollies

-  Detach the load spreader from the lid, fine to leave it attached to the crane.

-  Rotate the lid 180 degrees, and move it outside via the lift gate.

-  Shut the outer door

-  Open the inner door

-  Move the pallet back into the unpacking room

-  Leave the inner door open to provide enough space for the next steps.

Remove the Table from the Frame
-------------------------------

-  Assemble the cart around the shipping frame on the pallet.

-  Attach the 2x 2-wire lifting harnasses to the cart, and then to the load-spreader (which should still be on the crane)

-  Install the guide pins on opposite corners

-  Reposition the laod spreader to the cart position

-  slowly Lift the cart up to the bottom of the table

CAUTION: guide the cart around the wire springs.

-  While the cart is suspended, note its weight on the scale.

-  Loosely isntall 2 outboard bolts (through the thick brackets) to the bottom of the table.

NOTE: it may be necessary to loosen some of the cart bolts

-  Replace the guide pins with bolts.  There are now a total of 4 bolts installed

-  Tighten the 4 bolts

-  Tighten all cart bolts

-  Remove the bolts holding the table to the shipping frame

-  Adjust the load spreader to the table position

-  Attach the load balancing ropes to form a triangle above the load spreader.

-  Station workers on each end, to use the cart handles to guide the load

-  Slowly lift the instrument off the shipping frame

-  Being careful to not tip the instrument, move the pallet out from under it towards the outside door.

-  If not using the legs now, gently set the cart down on the floor.

Remove the Cart from the Table
------------------------------

-  If not already done, lift the cart+table off the floor with the crane

-  Wheel the legs under the table and lower it.  Alignment is not critical in the cleanroom, but try to center it.

-  Maintain 320 lbs (or the weight noted above) of pre-load on the crane

-  Remove the 4 bolts attaching the cart to the table

-  lower the cart with the crane to the floor

-  Place wood blocks under the short sides of the cart, and then remove the side of the cart along the clean room side

-  Wheel the instrument on the legs into the clean room.

-  Reassemble the cart, and wheel it into the cleanroom.

Reassemble the shipping box
----------------------------
-  Bring the lid back inside

-  Orient the pallet correctly (heavy side springs go toward back of lid)

-  Use the crane to install the lid on the pallet

-  Bolt it down

-  Install the removable side panel.

-  Forklift the box out of the unpacking room.
