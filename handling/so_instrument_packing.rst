Packing the MagAO-X Table at SO for Shipment
=============================================

This procedure describes how to pack MagAO-X optical table for shipment at Steward Observatory.

Estimated Time to Complete: 3 hrs

Safety 
------

-  All participanets must wear safety shoes

-  Hard hats must be worn when using an overhead crane at the loading dock 

Advanced Preparations and Scheduling
------------------------------------

-  Ensure the boxes, cart, and dollies are obtained from storage ahead of time 

-  Schedule delivery of a telehandler forklift.

-  Obtain the gantry crane from URIC

-  Order dessicant, thermal blankets, shrink wrap, and tape as needed

-  Verify all cart hardware is in-hand
   
-  Verify two wire harnesses are in hand

Initial Conditions
------------------

-  The optical table is in the cleanroom, fully
   disconnected from the control electronics.

Preparations
------------

-  While still powered up, secure all optics for transport

-  Check that all components on table are securely fastened.

-  Power down all of MagAO-X

   - Ensure that `stagepickoff` in the `out` position.
   - Place the k-mirror at 180 degrees.
   - turn off power for all devices on MagAO-X following the regular shutdown procedure.
   - use the `shutdown -h now` command to halt both RTC and ICC
   - once the computers are off, turn off all things in the rack.

-  Remove blower hose and cover the hole.

-  Remove all cables

   -  See detailed procedure for removing 2K DM cables
   
-  Tape over any cable holes, and secure any protruding cables.

-  Install dessicant.

-  Shrink-wrap the instrument.

-  Install the reflective blanket for solar shielding.

-  Remove cleanroom walls and roll the cleanroom over the testbed.

-  Lower table legs onto the casters by turning the 16 leveling bolts,
   and remove the metal pads

-  Ensure the area around the table is clear.


Rig Onto Cart
-------------

-  Setup the gantry crane in the hallway, at lowest setting, being sure to follow the marks 

-  Move the gantry into the lab 

-  Raise the gantry to the highest setting that the ducts will allow

-  Strap the two chain hoists onto the gantry

-  Move the gantry over MagAO-X, being sure to control the chains

-  Assemble the cart around MagAO-X, matching the corner labels

-  All bolts should be slightly loose at this point 

-  Raise the cart with chain hoists attached to the wire lifting triangles, ensuring it does not hit the table legs 

-  Install 4 bolts on the outboard side of the pads.  Tighten.

-  Now tighten all bolts on the cart.  Tighten until the washer stops moving, then back off 1/4 turn.  This is avoid unnecessary stress on the table.

-  Now lift the table+cart off the legs.  Do not go too high until all 4 pads have disconnected from the legs.

Prepare the Box.
----------------

-  Move the empty box and shipping frame into the unpacking room with
   the forklift, placing it on 4 furniture dollies.

-  Move the box towards the inside garage door, and stage 4 more
   dollies to accept the lid.

   *Box in position to have the lid removed.*

-  Remove the front panel from the box, place out of the way
   (e.g. outside).

-  Remove all bolts holding the lid to the pallet

-  Place the straight extension on the lifting fixture, and place it
   in the box-lid position.

-  Attach the lifting fixture to the lid.

-  Lift the lid with the crane, and set it down on the dollies.

   *Box lid off, on dollies.*

-  Move the pallet into the cleanroom to make room to maneuver the
   lid.

-  Then move the lid out of the way, e.g. outside on the lift.

Installing The Instrument On The Frame
--------------------------------------

-  Move the pallet and frame towards the front of the unpacking room.

-  Bring the instrument and cart out of the cleanroom.

   **NOTE: position the cart so that the taller heavier side of the
   instrument will set down on the side of the frame with the most
   wire-rope isolators.**

-  Install the scale between the load spreader and the crane, and
   place the lifting fixture in the instrument+cart position.

-  Install the triangle stabilizing rope ratchets, leaving them loose.

   *Preparation of the lifting fixture.*

-  With the crane, carefully position the load spreader over the
   table.

   **NOTE: be sure to guide both ends of the load spreader so it does
   not contact the instrument**

-  Attach the load spreader to the cart. Two shackles are used to
   extend the length. The hooks should be placed opening up.

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_extensions.jpg

   *Use two shackles for correct length.*

   .. image:: figures/cart_hooks_up.png

   *Hooks must open up on the cart to get the correct length.*

-  Lift the instrument+cart, which weigh **1920 lbs**, until all 4
   wheels are off the ground. If it is out of balance, it will be
   necessary to manually correct.

   *Lifting the instrument on its cart.*

-  Adjust the load spread to find the best balance.

-  Tighten the triangle stabilizing rope ratchets.

-  With a person on each end stabilizing using the cart handles, lift
   the instrument to sufficient height to clear the shipping frame.

-  Carefully roll the pallet and frame under the instrument

-  Lower the instrument slowly to just touch the frame, but do not
   unload the crane.

   *The instrument on the frame.*

-  While the instrument is still supported by the crane, start bolts
   at each corner to guide the instrument down.

-  Lower the instrument until half the weight is off the crane.

-  Start all bolts, including installation of the Emerson Clamp base
   plates.

-  Fully lower the instrument, such that the crane is still supporting
   the cart weight of **320 lbs**

-  Tighten all bolts holding the instrument to the shipping frame.

   *Tightening the bolts.*

-  Remove the 8 bolts holding the cart to the table.

-  Lower the cart so that it rests on the pallet.

   *The cart lowered onto the pallet.*

-  Disassemble the cart, moving the pieces to storage area.

-  Install the Emerson Clamps.

-  Arm all drop-n-tells, and install the data loggers.

Install the Lid and Door
------------------------

-  Move the pallet and instrument on the dollies back into the
   cleanroom to make space for the lid

-  Bring the lid back into the unpacking area and position it to be
   lifted on. The open side goes towards the MagAO-X label on the
   instrument.

-  Put the load spreader back in the position to balance the lid, and
   attach it with the crane to the lid.

-  Lift the lid, and roll the instrument under the box.

-  Set the lid down on the pallet

   *MagAO-X on the shipping frame inside the box.*

-  Install the bolts along the bottom of the lid, securing it to the
   pallet.

-  Bring the front door panel back inside, and lift it into position.

-  Bolt the lid on.

-  Remove the lifting eyes from the box lid and stow them on the lower
   left insspection panel.
