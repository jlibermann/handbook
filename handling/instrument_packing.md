## Installing The Instrument On The Frame

- [ ] Move the pallet and frame towards the front of the unpacking room.

- [ ] Bring the instrument and cart out of the cleanroom.

    **NOTE: position the cart so that the taller heavier side of the instrument will set down on the side of the frame with the most wire-rope isolators.**

- [ ] Install the scale between the load spreader and the crane, and place the lifting fixture in the instrument+cart position.

- [ ] Install the triangle stabilizing rope ratchets, leaving them loose.

    *Preparation of the lifting fixture.*


- [ ] With the crane, carefully position the load spreader over the table.

    **NOTE: be sure to guide both ends of the load spreader so it does not contact the instrument**

- [ ] Attach the load spreader to the cart.  Two shackles are used to extend the length.  The hooks should be placed opening up.

    ![ ](figures/cart_lift_extensions.jpg)

    *Use two shackles for correct length.*

    *Hooks must open up on the cart to get the correct length.*

- [ ] Lift the instrument+cart, which weigh **1920 lbs**, until all 4 wheels are off the ground.  If it is out of balance, it will be necessary to manually correct.

- [ ] Carefully roll the pallet and frame under the instrument

- [ ] Lower the instrument slowly to just touch the frame, but do not unload the crane.

    *The instrument on the frame.*

- [ ] While the instrument is still supported by the crane, start bolts at each corner to guide the instrument down.

- [ ] Lower the instrument until half the weight is off the crane.

- [ ] Start all bolts, including installation of the Emerson Clamp base plates.

- [ ] Fully lower the instrument, such that the crane is still supporting the cart weight of **320 lbs**

- [ ] Tighten all bolts holding the instrument to the shipping frame.

    ![ ](figures/bolt_tightening.jpg)

    *Tightening the bolts.*

- [ ] Remove the 8 bolts holding the cart to the table.
