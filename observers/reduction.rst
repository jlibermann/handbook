Data reduction and calibration
==============================

Sky Orientation
---------------

For data taken in 2022A: both camsci1 and camsci2 images are flipped
left-to-right (i.e. in X). To get north-up-east-left, flip the images
left-to-right, then rotate counter-clockwise by the angle given in
``PARANG`` in the headers.
