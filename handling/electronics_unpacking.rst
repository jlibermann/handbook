-  Obtain a ladder tall enough to reach the top of the (tilted) electronics box

-  Obtain 2 long ratchet straps to go around the box

-  Obtain 4x 1 m lifting straps

-  Assemble the T-shaped lifting fixture

-  Stage 8 shackles

Prepare Box For Unpacking
-------------------------

   *The electronics box staged in the cleanroom unpacking area.  Note the covers are still on the lifting points*

-  Reposition the Electronics Box using a pallet jack so that the lid/lifting-points are facing the outside garage door.

-  Wrap ratchet straps around the box to provide additional structural integrity, as shown below.

   *Repositioned for lifting and ratchet straps installed.*


Lift the Box
------------

-  Attach 4x 1 m straps in double pass (to be 0.5 m) to the lifting points on the side, using the center of the lifting fixture.  The straps will make a triangle on each side when the lift is complete.

   *Lifting fixture rigged to box lid.*

-  Begin Lifting Box, moving the crane truck as it lifts so that it pivots to upright.

CAUTION: The box should not be lifted off the ground using the lifting rings, these are only for tilting the box while it is contact with the ground.

-  Once it is fully upright, use a pallet jack to reposition the box to other end of room.

   *Using a pallet jack to reposition, moving the box to the right towards the outer garage door*

-  Install the braces

-  Unbolt the top lid (still attached to crane) and remove it with the crane.

   *Removing the lid*

-  Remove foam from the top of the rack

-  Remove straps from the lid and place it out of the way


Remove the Rack
---------------

-  Attach the lifting fixture to the electronics rack lift points, so that the crane is supporting the rack.  This is so that the rack can not tip out of the box on its own.

   *Attaching the lifting fixture to the rack using double shackles*

CAUTION: removing the side panel should only be done with the rack supported by the crane.

-  Remove all bolts on the side panel but two near the top.

-  With 2 workers holding the panel, remove the final two bolts.  Place the panel out of the way.

-  Remove the foam and place it out of the way.

   *After the side is removed and the foam is removed.*

-  After removing the foam on the side of the box,  lift the rack out of the box and set it on its wheels.

CAUTION: at least 2 workers should be on hand to steady the box and guide the rack out.

Stow the Box
------------

-  Attach side panel, attach all bolts.

-  Tilt the box back down using the inverse of the above procedure.  When empty, the ratchet straps do not need to be used.
