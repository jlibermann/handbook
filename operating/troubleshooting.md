# Troubleshooting

## Figuring out what exactly isn't working

To narrow down the failing component, use `xctrl status` to see if any MagAO-X apps are not running. The typical MagAO-X app is started by `xctrl startup` based on a line in a config file in `/opt/MagAOX/config/proclist_$MAGAOX_ROLE.txt`. This proclist determines which application to start and which config file from `/opt/MagAOX/config` should be supplied as the `-n` option (see [Standard options](#standard-options)). It also uses `sudo` to run the process as user `xsup`, regardless of which user called `xctrl startup`.

Many, if not all, MagAO-X apps are intended to run "forever" (i.e until shutdown). If the process is `dead`, you can attach to the `tmux` session that's the parent of the process in question with `xctrl inspect PROCNAME` (where `PROCNAME` is the name of the failed process). This will occasionally reveal error messages that did not get to the log.

For example, if `trippLitePDU` is started by `xctrl startup` with config specified by `-n pdu0` and there's a syntax error in `/opt/MagAOX/config/pdu0.conf` preventing startup, you can attach to the tmux session with

```
yourlogin$ xctrl inspect pdu0
```

The errors before exit, if any, will be in the log. The last few lines of the log can be checked with `logdump -f pdu0`. The command that started the app will be of the form `/opt/MagAOX/bin/$appName -n $configName`. You can use the up-arrow key in the tmux session to retrieve it from the shell history and try to relaunch once you've corrected whatever error was preventing startup.

## Addressing specific issues

### Shared memory image problems with "No space left on device" errors

When starting MagAO-X apps or CACAO apps that use shared memory images, the ImageStreamIO library will try to create shared memory images on `/milk/shm`. This can fail with an error like:

```
ERROR [ FILE: /opt/MagAOX/source/cacao/src/ImageStreamIO/ImageStreamIO.c   FUNCTION: ImageStreamIO_createIm_gpu   LINE: 521 ]
C Error: No space left on device
```

Indeed, if you use `df -h`, you'll see that `/milk/shm` is full:

```
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
[...]
tmpfs            63G   63G     0 100% /milk/shm
[...]
```

The solution is to [shut down](./shutdown.md) and then clear `/milk/shm`.

```
you$ su xsup
xsup$ cd /milk/shm
xsup$ rm *
```

If rerunning `df -h` *still* doesn't show any space available, something is probably holding a reference to the files. (See [this SuperUser question](https://superuser.com/questions/1100059/tmpfs-deleting-files-wont-free-the-space).) You should reboot the computer with `sudo reboot` (having already shut down / rested any hardware).

### RTC Lockup or Missing GPUs on RTC

The RTC occassionally locks up, or will lose a GPU (GPU has fallen off the bus errors).  It must be restarted to resolve.

1. If RTC is responding:
   1. Rest the woofer, tweeter, ttmmod, and ttmpupil.  Start camwfs warmup (you don't have to wait).
   2. Shutdown RTC (requires sudo)
      ```
      [user@exao2 ~]$ sudo shutdown -h now
      ```
   3. Now proceed to step 4.4 in the [System Power On](./startup.html#rtc_power_on44).

2. If RTC is not responding, or GPUs continue to fall off the bus after step 1.
   1. If you can, perform steps 1.1 and 1.2 above. 
   2. Power down RTC at PDU0 (e.g. with `pwrGUI`)
   3. Wait at least 10 seconds.
   4. Now perform all of step 4 in the [System Power On](./startup.html#rtc_power_on) procedure.

### OCAM connectivity / bad data

OCAM connects over two CameraLink connections. CameraLink #1 carries serial communication with the detector, so if you're able to command the camera but your data appear bad in `rtimv camwfs`, the culprit is likely the CameraLink #2 cable. Reseat, on ICC do `magaox restart camwfs`, and restart `rtimv`.

### Alpao DM not responding

Make sure it has been initialized. There is an `initialize_alpao` systemd unit that runs at boot and initializes the interface card. Successful execution looks like this in `systemctl status initialize_alpao` output:

```
$ systemctl status initialize_alpao
‚óè initialize_alpao.service - Initialize Alpao interface card
   Loaded: loaded (/opt/MagAOX/config/initialize_alpao.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

```

The script is saved at `/opt/MagAOX/config/initialize_alpao.sh`, if you want to see what it's doing. Note that executing it again will appear to fail with a message about not finding cards to initialize if the cards have been previously initialized.

### DM Latency and Communication Troubleshooting

There are various ways that the shared memory interprocess communication between the deformable mirrors, loop control(s), and the hardware control processes can stop functioning properly.

#### Examples with known fixes:

* Inability to set or zero flat or test from the dm control gui

    * This likely points to a bad semaphore.  Simply release DM, then re-initialize, and it usually clears.  If not, go to more general steps below.

    
* Excessive latency, occurs especially for ALPAOs

    * This usually requires a power cycle of the driver itself.  Release the DM, then use the power control GUI to turn off, then on the DM driver.

* Skipped commands

    * This is possibly caused by collisions on a semaphore, meaning more than one process is monitoring a given semaphore.  This can be diagnosed with `streamCTRL`. If this is not the case, a full software shutdown (both cacao and magao-x) and clearing the /milk/shm and /dev/shm directories (rm *), then restarting, should clear the problem. See step 5 below.

#### General Troubleshooting

General troubleshooting steps, in order of severity (try the lower ones first if you don't have a clear idea what the problem is):
1) release, then initialize from the `dmCtrl` GUI
2) release, then restart the DM controller software

    e.g. for the woofer:
    ```
    rtc$ xctrl restart dmwoofer
    ```
3) restart the dmcomb process:
    * first stop the DM controller (see above)
    * restart dmcomb using `fpsCTRL` (to be documented)
    * restart the DM controller (see above)
    * this may cause problems in some other processes due to shmim recreation.

4) Power cycle the DM
    * release from the `dmCtrl` GUI
    * turn off the power with the `pwrCtrl` GUI, then turn it back on
    * if it doesn't happen automatically, initialize the DM from the GUI when it has power
    * if this does not fix the problem, try steps 1-3 again.

5) Full Software Restart 
    * Place all hardware controlled from this computer in a safe condition
         * rest `modttm` and `ttmpupil`
         * start camera warmup (in case you can't get software back up)
         * release all DMs controlled from this computer
    * Shutdown all software with:
      ```
      rtc$ xctrl shutdown
      rtc$ tmux kill-server  # for cacao processes not managed by xctrl
      ```
    * Clear all shared memory:
      ```
       rtc$ cd /milk/shm
       rtc$ sudo rm *
       rtc$ cd /dev/shm
       rtc$ sudo rm *
      ```
    * Now restart software and restore hardware to operating condition

6) Reboot
    * This is a last resort.  This may be necessary if a problem has developed in the device driver for instance.
    * Follow procedure for computer reboot.  Ensure all hardware is in a safe condition, including powered-off if needed, before rebooting.

### EDT Framegrabber Problems (camwfs and camlowfs)

The EDT PCIe framegrabber occassionally stops responding.  The main symptom of this is no data from `camwfs`, and no response on the serial over camera link.  This has not yet been observed on `camlowfs` (which does not use serial over C.L.).

If `camwfs` (or any EDT camera) stops responding on serial, first shutdown the controlling application.

```
$ magaox inspect camwfs
<Ctrl-C>
```

then do these steps as root:

```
$ modprobe -r edt
$ cd /opt/EDTpdv
$ ./edt_load
```

This will reset the kernel module and restore operation.  Now restart the controlling application by returning to the tmux session, up-arrow to find the command, and press enter.

### Killing INDI zombies

If the `indiserver` crashes uncleanly (itself a subprocess of `xindiserver`), the associated `xindidriver` processes may become orphans (i.e. reparented to PID 1 (init)).  This will prevent `xindiserver` from starting again until these processes have been killed. (There will be output in logdump suggesting you `kill the zombies`.)

The following shell command will kill them:
```
$ kill $(ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}' | grep MagAOX/drivers | awk '{print $1}')
```
To check if any remain use
```
$ ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}' | grep MagAOX/drivers
```

### Difficulties with NVIDIA proprietary drivers

1. When installing, ensure you have `systemctl set-default multi-user.target` and a display is connected **only** to the VGA header provided by the motherboard
2. If NVIDIA graphical output did work, and now doesn't: Your kernel may have been updated, requiring a rebuild of the NVIDIA driver. Having `dkms` installed *should* prevent needing to do this, but an uninstall and reinstall over SSH will also remedy it.
2. Runfile installs can be uninstalled with `/usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-uninstaller`
